## DISCRIPTION ##
The Speech Recognition System is a cutting-edge web application that enables real-time voice-to-text transcription directly within the browser. Built using the React + Vite + TypeScript stack and styled with Tailwind CSS, the system delivers high performance, responsive design, and modern UI/UX.

This project integrates the Web Speech API to capture and process user speech, converting it into text seamlessly. The application is designed with accessibility in mind, allowing users to interact without using traditional input devices. This makes it ideal for voice assistants, productivity tools, and accessibility-focused platforms.

Key tasks included:

Implementing microphone input using browser-based APIs.

Converting speech to text and displaying results dynamically.

Managing application state and optimizing component structure in React.

Designing a clean, responsive interface with Tailwind CSS.

Building and deploying the frontend with Vite for fast development.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, all within a modern frontend framework. It exemplifies how AI capabilities can be embedded in web applications without requiring backend processing, ensuring a fast and lightweight user experience.

Through this internship at Codetech IT Solutions, I gained hands-on experience in AI-powered UI design, speech recognition integration, and frontend deployment. With mentorship from Neela Santosh, I was able to enhance my technical problem-solving, code organization, and real-world application development skills in just four weeks.
